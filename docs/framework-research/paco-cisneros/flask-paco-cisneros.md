## 🎯 **Research Focus Areas for Flask**

### **Priority Questions to Answer:**
1. **Extension Ecosystem**: Which Flask extensions are needed for authentication, file handling, and admin functionality?
2. **Configuration Complexity**: How much manual setup is required vs Django's batteries-included approach?
3. **Security Implementation**: What security measures require manual implementation vs automatic protection?
4. **Scalability Path**: How does Flask handle growing from simple to complex application needs?
5. **Development vs Production**: What's the gap between development ease and production readiness?

### **Key Comparison Points vs Django/FastAPI/Streamlit:**
- Minimalist approach vs full-featured framework
- Extension selection vs built-in functionality
- Custom implementation vs convention over configuration
- Learning curve vs flexibility trade-offs
- Performance overhead vs development convenience
