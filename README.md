# Python Mariachi Website
*Learning-Focused Full-Stack Python Development for Mariachi Todo Terreno*

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Python web development project to create a professional website for Mariachi Todo Terreno. The project serves dual purposes: providing a real-world application for the mariachi band and offering hands-on learning experience in modern Python web development, security engineering, and DevOps practices.

## 🎵 About Mariachi Todo Terreno

Mariachi Todo Terreno is a professional mariachi group led by Gerry Ochoa (trumpet). This website will serve both business needs (customer engagement, bookings) and internal band management (practice coordination, music library, scheduling).
