# Framework Research - Sprint 1
*Python Web Framework Evaluation for Mariachi Todo Terreno Website*

---

## 🎯 **Research Objective**
Evaluate and compare Python web frameworks to select the optimal technology for the Mariachi Todo Terreno website project, considering learning objectives, security requirements, and project-specific needs.

---

## 👥 **Team Assignments** *(Updated After Kickoff - November 11, 2025)*

### **Comprehensive Research Approach** *(NEW)*
**Each team member researches ALL 4 frameworks for thorough comparison**

| Team Member | Assignment | Due Date | Status |
|-------------|------------|----------|---------|
| **🥋 Paco "Sensei" Cisneros** | All Frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit) | Nov 17, 2025 | 🔄 In Progress |
| **💻 Carlos Cortes** | All Frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit) | Nov 17, 2025 | 🔄 In Progress |
| **🎯 Gerry Ochoa** | All Frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit) + Decision Matrix | Nov 17, 2025 | 🔄 In Progress |
| **🌱 Juan Marin** | All Frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit) + Website Design Mockup | Nov 17, 2025 | 🔄 In Progress |

**Final Decision Meeting**: November 17, 2025 (Monday Teams Meeting)  
**Additional Deliverable**: Juan presents website design mockup and recommendations
