# Asana Project Setup Guide
*Simple step-by-step guide for setting up the Python Mariachi Website project in Asana*

**Last Updated**: November 19, 2025  
**Purpose**: Clean setup instructions for Asana Free version

## 📋 **Understanding the Task Format**

Since Asana Free doesn't support custom fields, we use structured task naming:

### **Task Naming Format**
```
[Epic#] [Points] Task Name
```

**What the codes mean:**
- **[E1]** = Epic 1 (Technology Stack & Architecture)
- **[8]** = 8 Story Points (effort estimate using Fibonacci: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21)

### **Epic Reference**
- **E1**: Technology Stack & Architecture
- **E2**: Development Environment Setup  
- **E3**: Project Foundation & Infrastructure
- **E4**: Authentication & Security Framework
- **E5**: Public Website Development
- **E6**: Musicians Portal Development
- **E7**: Advanced Features & Integration
- **E8**: Infrastructure as Code & Deployment

### **Story Points Scale**
- **[1-2]**: Simple tasks (1-4 hours)
- **[3-5]**: Medium tasks (1-2 days)
- **[8-13]**: Complex tasks (3-5 days)
- **[21+]**: Break down into smaller tasks

## **Step 1: Create Project Sections**

Create these sections in your Asana project (copy exactly, including emojis):

1. 📋 Sprint Planning & Backlog
2. 🚀 Current Sprint
3. 👥 Team Research & Learning
4. 🏗️ Epic 1: Technology Stack (E1)
5. ⚙️ Epic 2: Environment Setup (E2)
6. 🏠 Epic 3: Project Foundation (E3)
7. 🔐 Epic 4: Security Framework (E4)
8. 🌐 Epic 5: Public Website (E5)
9. 🎵 Epic 6: Musicians Portal (E6)
10. ✨ Epic 7: Advanced Features (E7)
11. ☁️ Epic 8: Infrastructure & Deployment (E8)

## **Step 2: Add Team Members**

1. Click **"Share"** button in your project
2. Add team members with **Editor** permissions:
   - Paco "Sensei" Cisneros
   - Carlos Cortes  
   - Juan Marin
   - Gerry Ochoa (Admin)

---

## **Step 3: Create Initial Tasks**

Create these starter tasks in the appropriate sections (copy task names exactly):

### **In "👥 Team Research & Learning" section:**
- [E1] [8] Research Python Web Frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit)
- [E1] [5] Database Technology Selection (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite)
- [E1] [3] Architecture Decision Documentation

### **In "🏗️ Epic 1: Technology Stack (E1)" section:**
- [E1] [8] Framework Decision Matrix Creation
- [E1] [5] Technology Stack Documentation
- [E1] [2] Team Presentation Preparation

## **Step 4: Task Assignment Tips**

**Important**: Asana creates separate tasks when you assign to multiple people. This is normal behavior.

- **Individual tasks**: Assign to one person per task
- **Team collaboration**: Use comments and @mentions
- **Progress tracking**: Use subtasks for breaking down work
- **Dependencies**: Link tasks that depend on each other

---

## **Step 5: Project Settings**

1. **Project Description** (click project name → Edit details):
   ```
   Python web development for Mariachi Todo Terreno
   
   Team: Gerry Ochoa, Paco Cisneros, Carlos Cortes, Juan Marin
   Focus: Learning-oriented approach with Python frameworks
   Repository: https://github.com/g0ochoa/python-mariachi-website
   ```

2. **Set project to Private** (Project Settings → Privacy)
3. **Choose List View** for better task management

---

## **✅ You're Done!**

Your Asana project is now set up with:
- ✅ Organized sections for different work areas
- ✅ Team members added with proper permissions  
- ✅ Initial tasks using the naming convention
- ✅ Project configured for team collaboration

## **Next Steps**

1. **Create specific tasks** as needed using the [Epic#] [Points] format
2. **Use comments** for team communication on tasks
3. **Add due dates** and priorities as work progresses
4. **Update project status** regularly using project updates (not description)

## **Quick Reference**

**Task Format**: [E1] [8] Task Name  
**Epic Codes**: E1=Tech Stack, E2=Environment, E3=Foundation, etc.  
**Story Points**: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21 (Fibonacci sequence)  
**Collaboration**: Use @mentions in comments, not multiple assignees
