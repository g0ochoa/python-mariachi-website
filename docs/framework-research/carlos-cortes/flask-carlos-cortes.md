## 🎯 **Research Focus Areas for Flask**

### **Priority Questions to Answer:**
1. **Extension Ecosystem**: What's the quality and maintenance status of essential Flask extensions for authentication, admin, and file handling?
2. **Development vs Maintenance**: How does Flask's flexibility impact long-term maintenance and team collaboration?
3. **Security Implementation**: What security measures require manual implementation and ongoing maintenance?
4. **Admin Interface**: What are the options for creating admin interfaces comparable to Django's built-in admin?
5. **Production Complexity**: How much additional configuration is needed for production deployment?

### **Key Comparison Points vs Django/FastAPI/Streamlit:**
- Micro-framework flexibility vs full-featured framework convenience
- Extension selection freedom vs built-in functionality reliability
- Custom implementation control vs rapid development speed  
- Learning curve simplicity vs comprehensive feature availability
