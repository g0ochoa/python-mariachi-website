## 🎯 **Research Focus Areas for FastAPI**

### **Priority Questions to Answer:**
1. **Hybrid Architecture**: Can FastAPI effectively serve both traditional web pages and API endpoints for the dual-purpose application?
2. **Frontend Strategy**: What frontend approach would best complement FastAPI for the musician portal (React, Vue, vanilla JS)?
3. **Authentication Architecture**: How does JWT-based authentication work for mixed web/API usage patterns?
4. **File Handling Performance**: How does FastAPI handle large file uploads and serving for the music score library?
5. **Team Skills Alignment**: Does the modern async Python approach align with current team capabilities and learning goals?
