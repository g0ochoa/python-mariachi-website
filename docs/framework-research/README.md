# Framework Research Directory
*Individual research assignments for Python web framework evaluation*

---

## 🎯 **Research Objective**
Each team member researches ALL 4 Python web frameworks for comprehensive evaluation and comparison to select the optimal technology for the Mariachi Todo Terreno website project.

---

## 📁 **New Organized Structure**

### **Individual Research Folders**
Each team member has their own folder with personalized research files:

```
framework-research/
├── paco-cisneros/          # Paco's research files
├── carlos-cortes/          # Carlos's research files  
├── juan-marin/             # Juan's research files
├── gerry-ochoa/            # Gerry's research files
├── templates/              # Master template
└── decision-matrix.md      # Final comparison
```

### **Team Assignments**
| Team Member | Research Files | Status |
